                    Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating
                    images by recording light, either electronically by means of an
                    image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
                    material such as photographic film. It is employed in many
                    fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and
                    business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and
                    video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass
                    communication. A person who captures or takes photographs is
                    called a photographer.

                    Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or
                    emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive
                    surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an
                    electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at
                    each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a
                    digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The
                    result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image,
                    which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image,
                    either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the
                    photographic material and the method of processing. A negative
                    image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a
                    positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by
                    using an enlarger or by contact printing.
